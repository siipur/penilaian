'My Project'

Contributing workflow

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:
1.Fork this project to your account.
2.Create a branch for the change you intend to make.
3.Make your changes to your fork.
4.Send a pull request from your fork’s branch to our master branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
